# CV Update Instructions

## How to Replace the CV File

Since I cannot directly access your new CV file from the attachment, please follow these steps:

### Step 1: Replace the CV File
1. Navigate to the `public` folder in your project: `c:\Users\Youcode\Desktop\portfolio_2\public\`
2. Delete or rename the current `Anouar_Professional_CV.pdf`
3. Copy your new CV file (`Anouar_Professional_CV (2).pdf`) to the `public` folder
4. Rename it to exactly `Anouar_Professional_CV.pdf` (without spaces or numbers)

### Step 2: Update Image (Optional)
If you have a new profile image:
1. Add your new image file to the `public` folder
2. Update the image source in `app/page.tsx` line ~251:
   ```tsx
   src="/your-new-image-filename.png"
   ```

### Current Image
The portfolio is now using `/IMG_0144__1_-removebg-preview.png` which should look better with the removed background.

## What I've Fixed

### 1. Enhanced Download Functionality
- ✅ Added multiple fallback methods for CV download
- ✅ Improved error handling and user feedback
- ✅ Added loading states and success indicators
- ✅ Better timeout handling and retry mechanisms

### 2. Improved User Experience
- ✅ Button shows loading spinner during download
- ✅ Success checkmark when download completes
- ✅ Error state with clear messaging
- ✅ Automatic state reset after 2-3 seconds

### 3. Robust Error Handling
- ✅ Three different download methods:
  1. API route with proper headers
  2. Direct file access
  3. Force download as fallback
- ✅ Comprehensive logging for debugging
- ✅ File existence and size validation

### 4. Debug Endpoint
- ✅ Added `/api/debug-cv` to check CV file status
- ✅ Returns file existence, size, and readability info

## Testing the Fix

1. **Deploy the changes** to Vercel
2. **Test the download** by clicking the "Download CV" button
3. **Check browser console** for any error logs
4. **Verify the downloaded file** opens properly and isn't empty

## Debug Information

If the download still doesn't work, you can check:
- Visit: `https://your-site.vercel.app/api/debug-cv` to see file status
- Check browser developer tools console for error messages
- Verify the CV file exists and has proper size in the public folder

## File Structure After Updates

```
public/
├── Anouar_Professional_CV.pdf     # Your new CV (replace this)
├── IMG_0144__1_-removebg-preview.png  # Updated profile image
├── anouar.png                     # Old image (can be deleted)
└── ... other files
```

The download system now has triple redundancy and should work reliably across all browsers and devices!
